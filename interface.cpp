/*

to create the interface  in c++ we will create a abstract class which
having the abstract methods to be implemented

interface only contains the abstract methods 
normal methods are written in the interface
 interface:
   class with only the abstract methods all virtual void methods=0;
in c++ interfaces are implemented using interface only like we create a derive class of the
  base abstract class containing all the methods
